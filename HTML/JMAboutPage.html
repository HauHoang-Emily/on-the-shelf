          On The Shelf was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate bibliophiles who envisioned a digital haven for book enthusiasts worldwide. Frustrated by the limitations of traditional brick-and-mortar bookstores and inspired by the burgeoning potential of online commerce, they set out to create a platform that would revolutionize the way people discover and engage with literature. With a shared commitment to promoting reading culture and fostering community, they embarked on a journey to bring their vision to life.
